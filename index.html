                <p class="p"><span class="bold">Haii, my name is Dina. I came to the world on the 5th of May. I have been living on this planet for 20 years now. I study applied arts in the GUC.</span> 
                    I have been singing since i was six years old. Never been to a singing class in my life. My music taste is diverse, but my favorite genres are pop and R&B. I am obssesed with dogs,
                    cars and ice cream. I've learned to appreciate all sorts of art and expression on my own. Fun fact, i am first in my family to be interested in such aspects. I am very spontaneous and i enjoy doing
                    a ton of things. Along with singing, i love to dance. And as i mentioned that i study applied arts, so i love photography, videography and all that has to do with media design. But i also love
                    creating posters and illustrating all the mess in my mind onto paper and digitalizing it. One of my favorite elements of design would be collage! I love to collect leaflets and maps and different
                    magazines and take the time to make out crazy compositions from them.

                <p class="p"><span class="bold">A question i get asked a lot is why aren't my videos higher in quality? Why did it take me so long to actually create a singing page for myself?</span> 
                    The answer to such questions would be.... I don't think i was ever going to iniate that page in the first place, or sign myself up for any sort of talent show. But, after being 
                    provoked by my friends (shotout to you guys; especially mariam and farah) i had to start posting. Because well, they had already taken the first step of creating the page. More and above
                    , Mariam, being the craziest most spontaneous friend in my life, signed me up for a competition and sursprised me a few days before the audition. And despite the fact that i freaked out, 
                    I am wholeheartedly thankful to her irrational decisions because again, i would have never. I have no aim whatsoever from the page, i am grateful for all the followers i have and i feel 
                    responsibile to make them happy and i care not to let them down. But mainly, i sing for fun. I sing because i enjoy singing probably more than all my other hobbies and because it is my 
                    favorite way of expressing emotions.

                <p class="p"><span class="bold">I may be crazy annd i have a bunch of unnecessary theories about the world that may or may not intrigue you. You may not even care but curiosity will lead you.</span>
                    I believe a lot in karma. In the fact the what you put out in the world will someday return to you. In whatever form and whenever time. But it WILL return back to you eventually. Because, what goes
                    around comes back around. Which brings us to circles, loops, spirals. Call'em what you wanna call'em. But they are how the world revolves. Literally! The Earth is round and it revolves around the circular sun
                    in round orbits. The thoughts that get stuck in our heads and drown us are spirals of endless unanswered questions. If you think about it long enough you'll see my point of how circles are infinite just like
                    our lives, our souls, our existence. Infinite like our emotions that lay within us, trauma, pain, hurt, love, joy, gratitude, excitement. We have no limit whatsoever to the capacity that we get to feel
                    and the ideas we have to share, and that is what makes us limitless. Like spirals. In the section below, i have shared with you my favorite music albums, my favorite piece of writing and my favorite quote.

                <p id="eleven"> Seek out those who think differently from you and whom you will never be able to convince that you are right.
                    Because friendship is one of the many faces of Love, and Love is not swayed by opinions; Love accepts its companion 
                    unconditionally and allows each to grow in his or her own way. Love is an act of faith in another person, not an act of surrender.
                    Do not seek to be loved at any price, because Love has no price. Stay close to those who sing, tell stories, and enjoy life, and whose eyes sparkle with happiness. 
                    Because happiness is contagious and will always manage to find a solution, whereas logic can find only an explanation for the mistake made.
                    Stay close to those who allow the light of Love to shine forth without restrictions, judgments, or rewards, without letting it be 
                    blocked by the fear of being misunderstood.
                    No matter how you are feeling, get up every morning and prepare to let your light shine forth.
                    Those with eyes to see will see your light and be enchanted by it.  -Paulo Coelho

                    Just literally twenty seconds of just embarassing bravery. And i promise you, something great
                    will come of it."
